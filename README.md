## What it is all about?

Nothing, yet. Just another weird side-project and motivation to meet with typescrypt&nuxt&etc.
In future it might be a nice looking wrapper that manages and helps im printing labels with ql700. A 2020 glabel alternative.

## Styles/methodologies used in this project
 - From(obsolete?) githlub flow now i gonna stick into github flow with hub as backend
 - All further releases is created by semantic-release
# Recommended settings

For time of committing this word:
 - project is hardwired with ql-700 linux based
 - 62mm cont. label
 - minimum margin settings while printing
